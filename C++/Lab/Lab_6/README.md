**Task:**

You are given two sequences of integers arranged in ascending order. Your task is to combine the sequences into one ascending sequence. In order to get full marks, you have to make sure that the time complexity of combining two sequences is **O(N)**. You can safely assume that no integer will be repeated. Input starts with a positive integer **m** which specifies the number of elements in the first sequence. Next **m** values are the elements in the first sequence. The next positive integer **n** specifies the number of elements in the second sequence. Next **n** values are the elements in the second sequence. The output is the combined sequence.
